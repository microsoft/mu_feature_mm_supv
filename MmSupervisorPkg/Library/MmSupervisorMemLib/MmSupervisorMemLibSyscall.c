  Instance of MM memory check library.

  MM memory check library implementation. This library consumes MM_ACCESS_PROTOCOL
  to get MMRAM information. In order to use this library instance, the platform should produce
  all MMRAM range via MM_ACCESS_PROTOCOL, including the range for firmware (like MM Core
  and MM driver) and/or specific dedicated hardware.
