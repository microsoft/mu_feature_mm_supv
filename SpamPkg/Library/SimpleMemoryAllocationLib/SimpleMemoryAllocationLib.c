  Allocates one or more 4KB pages of type EfiBootServicesData.

  Allocates the number of 4KB pages of type EfiBootServicesData and returns a pointer to the
  allocated buffer.  The buffer returned is aligned on a 4KB boundary.  If Pages is 0, then NULL
  is returned.  If there is not enough memory remaining to satisfy the request, then NULL is
  returned.

  @param  Pages                 The number of 4 KB pages to allocate.

  @return A pointer to the allocated buffer or NULL if allocation fails.

/**
  Frees one or more 4KB pages that were previously allocated with one of the page allocation
  functions in the Memory Allocation Library.

  Frees the number of 4KB pages specified by Pages from the buffer specified by Buffer.  Buffer
  must have been allocated on a previous call to the page allocation services of the Memory
  Allocation Library.  If it is not possible to free allocated pages, then this function will
  perform no actions.

  If Buffer was not allocated with a page allocation function in the Memory Allocation Library,
  then ASSERT().
  If Pages is zero, then ASSERT().

  @param  Buffer                The pointer to the buffer of pages to free.
  @param  Pages                 The number of 4 KB pages to free.
