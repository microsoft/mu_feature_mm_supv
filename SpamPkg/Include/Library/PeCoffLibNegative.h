/** @file
  Base PE/COFF loader supports loading any PE32/PE32+ or TE image, but
  only supports relocating IA32, x64, IPF, ARM, RISC-V, LoongArch and EBC images.

  Caution: This file requires additional review when modified.
  This library will have external input - PE/COFF image.
  This external input must be validated carefully to avoid security issue like
  buffer overflow, integer overflow.

  The basic guideline is that caller need provide ImageContext->ImageRead () with the
  necessary data range check, to make sure when this library reads PE/COFF image, the
  PE image buffer is always in valid range.
  This library will also do some additional check for PE header fields.

  PeCoffLoaderGetPeHeader() routine will do basic check for PE/COFF header.
  PeCoffLoaderGetImageInfo() routine will do basic check for whole PE/COFF image.
