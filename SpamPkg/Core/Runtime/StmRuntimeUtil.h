/**
  The main validation routine for the SPAM Core. This routine will validate the input
  to make sure the MMI entry data section is populated with legit values, then hash
  the content using TPM.

  The supervisor core will be verified to properly located inside the MMRAM region for
  this core. It will then validate the supervisor core data according to the accompanying
  aux file and revert the executed code to the original state and hash using TPM.

  @param[in]  MmiEntryFileSize   The size of the MMI entry file.
  @param[in]  GoldDigestList     The digest list of the MMI entry and supervisor core.
  @param[in]  GoldDigestListCnt  The count of the digest list.
  @param[out] NewPolicy          The new policy populated by this routine.
